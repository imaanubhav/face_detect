# Face, eye and smile detection with webcam (using openCV)

Project is based on Viola-Jones Algorithm in which face, eye and smile of person is detected in video captured with webcam. I've used already trained haarcascades provided by opencv (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascade).
